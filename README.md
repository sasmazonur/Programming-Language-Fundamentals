## Class Description
The course introduces concepts found in a variety of programming languages and exposes studentsto non-imperative programming paradigms. Topics to be covered include: functional programmingin Haskell, logic programming in Prolog, syntax, scoping, parameter passing, types, polymorphism,exception handling, semantics.

## Learning objectives: 
Upon completing the course, students are expected to be able to:
* 1) Design and implementa functional program, usingalgebraic data typesandrecursive functions,from an informal specification and example input-output pairs.
* 2) Produce and explainthetypeandresultof an expression within a larger functional program.
* 3) Produce and explainanabstract syntax, using a context-free grammar, for a language given adefinition of its concrete syntax.
* 4) Analyze and reducea language, by applying the concept ofsyntactic sugar, to its minimal core ofessential features.
* 5) Produce and explainhow a programâ€™s output and behavior differs based on a variety of languagedesign decisions related to naming, such asstatic vs. dynamic scopeandcall-by-value vs. call-by-namevs. call-by-needparameter passing.
* 6) Design and implementadenotational semanticsorinterpreterfor a language given its abstractsyntax and an informal specification of its behavior, which may include features such as naming,state, functions, and/or exceptions.
* 7) Design and implementa logic program, usingqueriesover recursively definedpredicates, froman informal specification and example results.
