# Karel Semantics
## Description
The Karel language is a simple imperative programming language for directing an on-screen robot. The robot can move around a grid, pick up and place “beepers”, and test aspects of its environment to determine what to do next. The syntax of the language is based on Pascal.

In this program implements an interpreter for a slightly modified version of Karel. This version is feature-complete with the real Karel, but the syntax has been updated to be a bit more concise and orthogonal.
